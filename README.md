# Employee Attrition Prediction Project

## Overview
This project analyzes factors influencing employee attrition using machine learning. The goal is to predict whether an employee will leave a company based on features such as job role, salary, work-life balance, promotions, and remote work status. The analysis leverages a public Kaggle dataset with **70,000+ entries** and includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and three classification models.
